//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let my_fav_mode = "motorcycle";
let myownArray = [
  "Honda motorcycle",
  "CD motorcycle",
  "125 Honda motorcycle",
  "Yamma Honda motorcycle",
];

console.log(
  `I would like to own a ${myownArray[0]} because my favorite mode is ${my_fav_mode}`
);
console.log(
  `I would like to own a ${myownArray[1]} because my favorite mode is ${my_fav_mode}`
);
console.log(
  `I would like to own a ${myownArray[2]} because my favorite mode is ${my_fav_mode}`
);
console.log(
  `I would like to own a ${myownArray[3]} because my favorite mode is ${my_fav_mode}`
);
