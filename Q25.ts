//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

// Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

let alien_color = "green";
if (alien_color === "green") {
  console.log("player just earned 5 points");
} else {
  console.log("The player just earned 0 points.");
}

//Another Approach where I use a function to generate a random color and then compare it with the player's guess
let alien_colors: string[] = ["green", "yellow", "red"];

function guessAlienColor(player_guess: string) {
  // Select a random color from the array
  let alien_color =
    alien_colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * alien_colors.length)];

  // Check the player's guess against the alien's color
  if (player_guess == alien_color) {
    console.log("Correct! The player just earned 5 points.");
  } else {
    console.log(
      `Sorry, the correct color was ${alien_color}. The player just earned 0 points.`
    );
  }
}

// Now you can call the function with the player's guess
guessAlienColor("green");
